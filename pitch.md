## Intro
Hi I'm Anthony Mandela, CEO of NexFitness and this is Ryan Castner CTO.

## Summary
NexFitness is a crowd sourced fitness video training platform with a twist. We've thought of a unique approach that will allow us to build the best video workout library on the web.

## Question
How many of you have tried an online workout video before?

## Problem
Well, like me, you probably know how difficult it is to stay motivated with your workouts. What is the best way to stay interested over the long run? Variety. Trying out new instructors and lots of different classes and teaching styles.
Unfortunately, video workout content is scattered piecemeal across the web. Free content, paid content. Good quality, crappy quality. Fantastic instructors, horrible instructors. 2 minute videos, 2 hour videos. Where do you even start?

## Solution
Imagine a one-stop-shop where you can discover new fitness instructors daily, explore great content, and organize workout video playlists tailored to your fitness goals and interests. Think of NexFitness as your fitness training home base, kind of like the iTunes for fitness video.

## How are we going to stand out?
Bottom line: Because we are the only video training website that also provides a vital service to our fitness instructors—help growing their businesses. Taking their brands from the local community level to regional, national, and (eventually) global scale.


In the next round, I’d love to tell you more about our instructor matching algorithm and our retreat planning tools that help instructors find top-rated fitness venues and create custom landing pages for their next event.


## Expertise
I've spoken with hundreds of fitness instructors during my time working at a startup in the fitness/wellness space called Aqua Nicaragua. The tools we are building are based on years of experience.

Thank you for your time.
